# Raspberry Pi / Ubuntu easy Python installer

An easy way to install a new Python version on a Raspberry Pi. Works also on Ubuntu!

## Installation

No real installation needed.

You can simply run this installer by

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tvdsluijs/raspberry-pi-python-sh-installer/main/python[python_verion].sh | sudo bash
```

fill in the Python version you want at `[python_verion]`

So, if you want to install version 3.9.3 do:

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tvdsluijs/raspberry-pi-python-sh-installer/main/python3.9.3.sh | sudo bash
```
on your Raspberry Pi or Ubuntu Environment.

**NOTE**

This script updates your Raspberry Pi OS !!! If you don't want to update the OS DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT!
